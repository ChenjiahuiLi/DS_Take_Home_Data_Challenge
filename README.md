### 02 Spanish Translation AB Test
- two sample ratio test: hypothesis statement, z statistics, upper $1-\alpha$ quantile of Normal distribution
- subsetting pandas dataframe: df.loc[df['column_name'] == condition]
- inner join pandas dataframes: df1.join[df2.set_index('foreign key'), on = 'foreign key']
- COUNT DISTINCT in python: df['user_id'].unique()
- subset with rows and columns selection: df.loc[df.col1 == value1, ['col2','col3']]
- reset_index: for data frames with row names, such as df created by using groupby, use reset_index to make the row names as a independent column
